### What was the overall architecture of your system (particularly if it is different from the demo system)?
The group had collectively decided that we will utilize a 3-tiered architecture.
### What went right in the development process?
During the course of the development process, communication evolved after each and every iteration. The group was able to communicate about which components needed to be completed, and how to link them together. We also all came together at the end to round off the features the best we could.
### What went wrong in the development process?
The outlying issue for our development process was understanding the time management we would really need to balance this course and project, along with other courses and our lives outside of the project. There was also a bit of a miscommunication error, but by the end we all managed to work together to improve on these issues.
### What would you do differently, if you had the chance to start over?
If we had the chance to start over, I think that we would definitely communicate a lot more and distribute the work much more accordingly. This is primarily from earlier iterations as we had not realized just how much work each layer would take up.
### How large is the project (number of methods, classes, etc)? How much of this is (roughly) devoted to each major system component? And any other quantifiables (e.g. if you have a record of hours spent on tasks).
The project overall contains approximately 69 different classes among all layers. There is roughly 70 - 80% that are devoted to major system components.
### What took the most time? The least? Any surprises?
One particular feature from across all the layers was the playing the quizzes themselves. It wasn’t just creating a front end page, but also learning all about how XML files work within android studio was both surprising and frustrating. Then also how to link each layer to one another initially.
One feature from across all the layers that took the least amount of time to implement would need to be the preview and end pages as once we were comfortable, creating the UI layer was much easier, and linking it to the logic layer, then the data layer was a lot simpler due to the group keeping good and consistent coding practices throughout the process. This fluid process was the biggest surprise of all.
### Are there any particular design smells, or brilliant design decisions?
One particular design smell relates to the tests themselves, specifically the system tests. They are not as thorough as we would like them to be, and this was a result of needing to rush them due to time constraints.
The brilliant design decisions definitely came from the UI layer, there is a fun little easter egg where if you play the game enough, there is a 1 in 10 chance of a certain quiz completion track playing.
### Are there any outstanding bugs?
The one outstanding bug that we realized after the fact, is when creating accounts. We set all of the usernames to lowercase when putting them into the database, now because of this, when a user tries to log in using uppercase it does not work. Other than that, there aren't any outstanding bugs that severely affect the users experience or would come about due to extreme edge cases.
### Did any features work better than expected?
The leaderboard function is honestly the one component that stands above all the others in terms of working better than how we expected it to. It worked really well in that it consistently updated the score preemptively before the user had ended their session of the quiz so they could see if they placed in the top 5.
### Are you using any technologies other than what was required (e.g. JMock, GUI builders, etc.)?
No, we had primarily used the technologies that were provided to us for this project.
### Are you using any specific techniques covered in the course (TDD, pair programming, scrums, etc)?
For our project, we particularly utilized a minor form of agile where we had discussions at our meetings every week about where we were at, the retrospective for that iteration, and the improvements and additions we are going to make in future iterations. Unfortunately, this was mostly by word of mouth so there are only scraps of information left over from each of these meetings.
We had also tried to utilize pair programming when splitting the work amongst each of the team members. When working on a feature, we would have 2 people working on the UI layer, then 2 on the Logic layer, and then 1 on the database layer.
### How did the project change from your initial (iteration 0) vision or stories, or did it work out as predicted?
The project definitely changed from iteration 0 as we had  to scrap a lot of ideas due to time constraints and over estimating how much time each feature took to fully complete. If given more time, the project definitely could have evolved into much more.
### What did you learn about team or large project development? What will you start doing, keep doing, or stop doing next time?
We had learned that it is very tough managing your time between being a student, and working on a larger scale project both at the same time. We had also learned that keeping notes about the retrospective becomes very helpful when creating a personal roadmap to the next component of a feature. We had also learned that it is a lot easier to work in teams with other people because it gets more work done in a shorter amount of time, due to bouncing ideas off of on another
We will start managing our time more appropriately, keeping notes from meetings to help future development. We will continue to work in teams putting in an equal amount of work, communicating with one another so that we can shape the project’s final vision faster than with only one person.
### Can you draw any conclusions from what you’ve done?
The conclusions that can be drawn, would be gaining more experience from a deeper understanding of languages like java, XML, and SQL when doing project development, gaining more experience work in a team with different layers of a project and the communication associated with it, and that time management and task distribution are a very large deciding factor when it comes to starting a project and working through it.
